How to build the project:
* Download Android Studio.
* Make sure you have V27 SDK.
* Once you clone the project, clean & rebuild project from Android Studio.
* Run "app" from Android Studio to install and run in the app in your physical device and emulator.

Third party libraries:
* gson -- parse json data in class object format.
* de.hdodenhof:circleimageview  -- turn imageview to rounded imageview.
* android.arch.lifecycle  -- ViewModel to persist data across all fragments.
* recyclerview  -- display list view.

Future improvments & optimizations:
 * Replace custome http with retrofit.
 * Use RxJava to make it reactive.
 * Use MVP instead of MVC.
 * Better support for different screen size.
 * Data caching based on server versioning.
