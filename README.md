# MetalPayDemo

How to build the project:
1). Download Android Studio.
2). Make sure you have V27 SDK.
3). Once you clone the project, clean & rebuild project from Android Studio.
4). Run "app" from Android Studio to install and run in the app in your physical device and emulator.

Third party libraries:
gson -- parse json data in class object format.
de.hdodenhof:circleimageview  -- turn imageview to rounded imageview.
android.arch.lifecycle  -- ViewModel to persist data across all fragments.
recyclerview  -- display list view.

Future improvments & optimizations:
1). Replace custome http with retrofit.
2). Use RxJava to make it reactive.
3). Use MVP instead of MVC.
4). Better support for different screen size.
5). Data caching based on server versioning.
